Commands of interest:
  Note that all commands are relative to cpsc301-pynx/server/, meaning you must
  be in that directory to execute.

  To install dependencies:
    # Ensure you're in the server directory first -- e.g., cpsc301-pynx/server/.
    npm install express mocha sqlite3

  To set up database:
    bin/create_db # May re-run to overwrite database with virgin copy.

  To run:
    node src/app.js
    curl localhost:8888 # Test to ensure server is running.

  To execute tests:
    # First, start server with NODE_ENV environment variable set to test, so
    # that fixtures may be loaded remotely.
    NODE_ENV=test node src/app.js
    node_modules/.bin/mocha

Troubleshooting:
  If you receive this error:
    node.js:201
      throw e; // process.nextTick error, or 'error' event on first tick
            ^
    TypeError: Cannot read property 'port' of null
      at Object.<anonymous> (/home/uga/jawinter/work/cpsc301-project/server/src/app.js:47:76)
      at Module._compile (module.js:432:26)
      at Object..js (module.js:450:10)
      at Module.load (module.js:351:31)
      at Function._load (module.js:310:12)
      at Array.0 (module.js:470:10)
      at EventEmitter._tickCallback (node.js:192:40)
  ... then the problem is that a server is already listening on the same port.
  Change the serverPort in src/config.js and try again. (Make sure you don't
  commit this change to the Git repo, however.)
