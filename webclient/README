# HTML navigation design

The general idea is that the state of the navigation bar can be changed by toggling the visibility of different <div> tags. In particular, there are two IDs of interest:

1. authenticated-nav: contains all of the `authenticated-only' navigation options.
2. admin-nav: contains the `Administrator-only' navigation options.

# Template naming scheme
<subsystem>-<type>-template
Examples:
- authentication-login-template
- memo-list-template
- memo-list-item-template
- memo-view-template

# Template element naming scheme
Strip off the -template from the template name, and append whatever is necessary to that.
Examples:
- memo-view-edit
- memo-edit-submit

# Commenting guidelines
The general idea is to provide a brief overview of what each section of code does. Nothing
too in-depth is required, but some general guidelines might be:
- Provide a one-line description comment for each `class'.
- Provide a one-line description comment for each method.
- Provide a one-line description comment for non-obvious attributes.
- Document anything that seems non-obvious.
