Below follows a consultation with Jeff's designer friend Alex about our initial mockups.

Search should be consistent
  Centre the search
  Put it in top right/left, just below horizontal bar
    On opposing side of it, have header describing what page you're on ("Dashboard", "Discussion")
      Then, search always stays in exact same spot
  How we should have search bar on every page: like on search results page, with bar across top -- perhaps centre it

  Calling attention to search:
    Can put light grey bar behind it
    Don't necessarily need logo over search bar all the time -- just need text input, search button

  Dashboard: way too much text currently
    Look at news sites -- their target audience is people who want info quickly
      How do they handle headline typography? People just scan headlines ("Heart Palpitations"), don't read text below

    Need way to distinguish between different memos/discussions
      Hierarchy of content now: very even, very heavy
      For Dashboard, have identifiable cues that will indicate importance
        Perhaps colour, perhaps differnet icons for different types

Top navigation is good right now -- perhaps make "logout" text smaller, same size as "Memos"
  User name should also be same size as rest of text
  It should just be text -- not a button
  "Logout" could have door opening/closing
    Don't make it button -- that makes people more likely to look to it as first action

Memos:
  Reduce information presented
  Show only headline -- expands upon click to show full text
    Provide comment form

Biggest thing we need to worry about: clarifying exact functionality
  What can we do to make it more of an app? To cut down information, to give more useful things?

  Good use of welcome message
  Shows clearly what you can do on dashboard without being overwhelming -- edit stuff, add picture, etc.
    Clearly shows what you can do

Numero uno key message: establish your goals for project, then figure out how to express those in design
  Good example: http://dribbble.com/shots/323757-Device-Dashboard-iPad-UI-UX-iOS/attachments/14426
    You see that thre are devices and teams
    Not lots of information presented, but you can see exactly what's there, and what you can do with it
    Good use of icons to simplify delivery -- simpler than text
      Based on design, you can see that icons are sub-nav of Devices
      Key idea: little things that break up design, make information useful

Whenever we come to dispute about design, make "mock profile" of user -- "52 year old doc, very busy, needed by lots of people; not up to date with latest tech, but knows his field inside-out; what would Frank the Doctor prefer in this situation?"

Misc:
  Add active states for navigation in nav bar at top
