How many memos per day?
  Dealing with 10 users completely different from dealing with 100
    IIRC, we'll have 60-70 docs, 20-30 residents

Who can post memos?
  Probably need all users in system (or at least all docs) to have this ability
    But then this creates enormous number of memos -- everyone will have different criteria as to what's important enough for a memo
  So, then, question becomes, How do we prioritize memos? What signals to use?
    Time
    User importance
      Can be assigned by admin, or can be calculated algorithmically
        Given small scale of system, manual assignment by admin probably better
    Category (importance differs -- "Ecstasy treatment policy change" vs. "Microwave use in lounge")

How many discussion posts per day?
  Discussion posts should be separated from memos in UI, even if handling on backend is unified
  How to rank?
    Use same signals as memos (time, user importance, category)?
      Use same weighting or different?
